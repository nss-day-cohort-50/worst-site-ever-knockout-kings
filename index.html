                    <h3>Beginner</h3>
                        <p>
                            10 minutes a day doing single arm and the illustrious double arm action will be enough to turn your lazy day into one of productivity. Make sure to spread it out, and take breaks when necessary.
                        </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Intermediate</h3>
                        <p>
                            For those looking to move past beginner and really shape that summer bod, look no further than the Intermediate workout. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            10 minutes, 2x a day, will bring tone to your body like never before believed. Do at least one of the 10 minute sessions without breaking, alternating between arms and single/double pump action. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This one is not for the faint of heart, and only for those ready to elevate their health, fitness, and get that Beyonce body they've always dreamed. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Aside from using the heaviest Shake Weight possible, this workout calls for a 2 hour workout, 2x a day, absolutely <b>NO</b> breaks. Try doing this while jogging up a flight of stairs for extreme effort. After this, you should be ready for the Olympics or something, give it a try.
